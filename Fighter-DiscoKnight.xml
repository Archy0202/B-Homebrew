            <p>This feature gives the same benefits as the "Unarmed Fighting" fighting style and an additional bonus.</p>
            <p class="indent"> Your Unarmed Strikes deal Bludgoening damage equal to 1d6 + your strenght modifier on a hit. If your not wielding weapons or a shield the d6 becomes a d8. </p>
            <p> Additionally, from 6th level, your Unarmed Strikes are considered magical if you have an active combo. This is to overcome resistance and immunity to non-magical weapons and attacks. </p>

            <p>Starting from 3rd level, you gain a Disco Beat. It's a special rythm only you can hear that drives you during combat.</p>
            <h4>Follow the Beat</h4>
            <p> At the start of Combat, you designate an enemy that becomes your Target. On your turn, if you attack the "target" and manage to hit an unarmed strike you start a Combo </p>
            <p class="indent">Combo builds for each successful unarmed strike you make against the target up to a value equal to your performance modifier</p>
            <p>At the end of your turn, the creature that is your "target" chnages, you pick another crature within 15ft of you and they become the next target. As long as you attack a creature that is the "target" you continue to maintain and build combo. if you attack an creature that isnt the target your combo breaks and drops to zero.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the creature that is your target dies, on the start of your next turn you designate another creature as the new target. </p>
